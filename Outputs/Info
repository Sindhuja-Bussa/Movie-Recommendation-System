Movie Recommendation System
Recommender system is a tool that predicts what a user might like based on their previous choices. These systems are commonly used in various fields, such as movies, music, news, books, research articles, search queries, social tags, and products. They generate a list of recommendations using two main methods:
Collaborative Filtering: This method builds a model based on the user's past behavior (like items they have purchased or searched for) and the behavior of other similar users. The model then predicts items or ratings for items that the user might be interested in.
Content-Based Filtering: This method uses the characteristics of an item to recommend other items with similar properties. It relies entirely on the description of the item and the user’s past preferences to suggest new items. Essentially, it recommends items based on what the user has liked before.
Let’s create a basic recommendation system that suggests movies similar to a movie the user likes. This system will help find movies that share similarities with the user’s favorite movie using Python and Pandas.

Objective:
The objective of this Movie Recommendation System is to give users highly accurate and personalized movie suggestions based on their preferences and inputs. This system aims to provide precise recommendations, even if the movie titles entered by users are slightly incorrect. By customizing suggestions to each user's tastes and ensuring an easy and enjoyable experience, this system seeks to increase user engagement and satisfaction, making it fun and effortless for everyone to discover new movies.
Data Source: The dataset for this project comes from the YBI Foundation Kaggle repository. It includes information about movies, user ratings, and other relevant features needed to build the recommendation system.
